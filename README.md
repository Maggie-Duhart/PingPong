# PingPong
PingPong Game Python

My first game in Python

Rules: 
Player A uses key "w" to go up and "s" to go down 
Player B uses Arrow Up key to go up and Arrow Down key to go down

The goal of the game is to hit the ball back and forth over the paddles, trying to score points by making the ball hit the opponent's side of the screen

Have fun!!
